                                  CODE OF STATE

APPEAL OF CIVIL PENALTY ASSESSMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. (ยง 7-2002)

(a) Any person assessed a civil penalty or an administrative fee may appeal by
filing a written notice of appeal with the Director of the Solid Waste Services
Department within ten (10) days after service of the written demand for payment
of the assessment. The written appeal shall provide the reasons the petitioner
contends that the administrative fee or civil penalty was wrongly applied and
any supporting documentation. Failure to file a notice of appeal within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the civil penalty
or the administrative fee.

(b) Using the information provided, the Director of the Solid Waste Services
Department shall conduct a review of the appeal. The Director of Solid Waste
Services may amend or reverse the assessment.

(c) Unless the Director of Solid Waste Services resolves the appeal, the
Director of Solid Waste Services shall schedule the appeal for determination by
the City Council if the person who filed the appeal so requests. The City
Council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal, shall give due
notice of such hearing to the petitioner and the City Manager, and shall render
its decision in a reasonable time.

(d) The City Council&#8217;s decision on a civil penalty appeal or an
administrative fee is subject to further review in the Superior Court of Wake
County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for writ of
certiorari shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court within thirty (30)
days after the date that the City Council&#8217;s decision is issued.
