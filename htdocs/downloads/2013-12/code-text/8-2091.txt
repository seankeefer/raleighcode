UTILITY MAIN POLICY. (ยง 8-2091)

It shall be the utility main policy of the City, subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth herein, to reimburse developers who install major water
and sewer mains either inside or outside the corporate limits the proportionate
cost of any installation made in excess of a six-inch water main or an
eight-inch sanitary sewer main from acreage fees collected in the same acreage
fee area of the installation, with an opportunity for reimbursements not to
exceed ten (10) years; but nothing herein shall prevent the opportunity for full
reimbursement of major sewer lines fifteen (15) inches or greater in size. The
City will not apply for any reimbursements for installations made by it for
mains greater than twenty-four (24) inches in diameter, unless another unit of
government, sharing with the City in the funding of such an installation,
applies for reimbursement on a particular project.
