ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLANS. (§ 8-2120)

(a) The POTW Director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs a plan or other action to control and prevent slug discharges. All SIUs
must be evaluated within one year of being designated an SIU. The POTW Director
may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the POTW Director may develop such a plan for any user.

(b) All SIUs are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for spills and other accidental discharges,
discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge,
or a slug load. Also see §§8-2132 and 8-2133 of this article.

(c) 

   (1) 	Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
   discharges; 
   

   (2) 	Description of stored chemicals;
   

   (3) 	Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW Director of any accidental
   or slug discharge, as required by §8-2133 of this article; and 
   

   (4) 	Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any slug discharge. Such
   procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of
   storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
   operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of
   containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
   pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
   response.
