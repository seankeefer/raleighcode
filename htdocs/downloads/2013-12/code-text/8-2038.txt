DEPTH AT WHICH SEWER LINES TO BE LAID; CITY INSTALLATIONS. (ยง 8-2038)

The City shall not be obligated to install facilities to provide gravity sewer
service to any floor level of any existing or proposed structure at an elevation
lower than ten (10) feet below the crown of the street directly in front of the
structure. Notwithstanding this provision, property owners desiring that the
line be placed at a depth greater than necessary to serve a floor level ten (10)
feet below the crown of the street shall be required to pay the difference in
cost of laying such line at that depth and the depth at which the property owner
desires the line to be laid. Such cost shall be estimated by the City based on
the difference in cost for installing a line at twelve (12) feet of depth and
the depth at which the property owner desires the line to be laid. Payment of
the estimated cost shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of the
demand for payment or the line will be laid at a depth as if the property owner
had not requested that the line be installed at a greater depth. Notwithstanding
the payment of the estimated cost of the greater depth of lines, the property
owner making the payment shall still be assessed for his proportionate cost of
the installation of the line consistent with the normal assessment policy.
