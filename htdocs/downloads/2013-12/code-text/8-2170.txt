MAJOR WATER USERS. (ยง 8-2170)

All major water users are required to develop a conservation program and an
emergency water usage reduction plan to focus on reducing water consumption, to
include BMPs or policy for their specific uses of water in their
business/commercial applications or manufacturing processes. The program shall
be designed to reduce water consumption when the City implements water
conservation measures in Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3. The conservation program
shall be submitted to Public Utilities for review and approval within one
hundred and eighty (180) days of notification by the City. Programs shall be
implemented in accordance with the implementation of the City&#8217;s water
conservation ordinances. Each conservation program shall be updated by the major
water user as required by the Public Utilities Director. In addition, all major
water users will conduct an American Water Works Association industrial water
audit, or equal, upon request by the Public Utilities Department. This audit
will be submitted to the Public Utilities Department, and subsequently updated
every 5 years.
