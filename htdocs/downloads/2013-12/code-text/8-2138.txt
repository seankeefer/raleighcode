SAMPLE COLLECTION. (ยง 8-2138)

(a) All waste water samples must be representative of the user&#8217;s
discharge. Waste water monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.

(b) Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40
CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be
representative of the user&#8217;s discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for
additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90 Day Compliance
Reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of multiple grabs
during a 24 hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under
40 CFR 136.

(c) Composite Samples: All waste water composite samples shall be collected with
a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge.
All waste water composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional
composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When authorizing
time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and
the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.
