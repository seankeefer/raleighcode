FUND MANAGEMENT. (§ 9-10008)

It is recognized that all projects otherwise eligible according to the
provisions of §9-10007 are not necessarily suitable for the installation of
public art. If it is determined that a project is not suitable for public art
the one-half (½) per cent of its cost will be placed into an account for the
maintenance and acquisition of public art. Money held in this account may only
be appropriated upon recommendation from the Public Art and Design Board. Money
from this fund may be used to maintain art, acquire art for public projects that
do not qualify under §9-10007 or to supplement the one-half (½) per cent
amount for an eligible project. The fund may be used for artist design services,
acquisition of art, maquettes, shipping or other expenses, including
administration of the program, required to obtain and place the art. It is
permissible to spend more than one-half (½) per cent of the project cost on art
for the project so long as the remainder of the cost is privately funded or paid
for by an additional appropriation upon recommendation by the Public Art and
Design Board.
