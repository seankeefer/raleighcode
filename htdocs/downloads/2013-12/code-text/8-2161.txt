PURPOSE AND INTENT. (ยง 8-2161)

It is the purpose and intent of this article to assure that available water
resources are put to reasonable beneficial uses to avoid depletion of the City
water supply during a water shortage and to ensure that demand does not exceed
the City&#8217;s capacity for water treatment and distribution. This article
shall be liberally construed to implement such purpose and intent.
