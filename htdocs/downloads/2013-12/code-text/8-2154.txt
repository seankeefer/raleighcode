                                  CODE OF STATE

TESTING AND MAINTENANCE OF DEVICES. (§ 8-2154)

The consumer at each property at which containment and/or confinement device(s)
have been installed, except those with devices installed in accordance with
§8-2148(a) of this Code, shall have each containment and/or confinement
device(s) tested on an annual basis, and perform any routine maintenance to such
device as recommended by the manufacturer, and provide the cross connection
coordinator with a report of that inspection and work. Backflow prevention
devices that require testing must be done so with equipment approved by the City
of Raleigh. The consumer shall cause such maintenance or repairs to be made,
rendering the device fully operational. Failure of the consumer to perform that
testing and maintenance shall be cause for the premises to be deemed an
immediate public health hazard. The Director of Public Utilities may immediately
thereafter discontinue public water supply service to that premises and service
shall not be restored until such devices have been rendered fully operational.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations or
protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate containment or confinement
devices shall be provided by the property owner to avoid the necessity of
discontinuing water service to test or repair the device or devices.
