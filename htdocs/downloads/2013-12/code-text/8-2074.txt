                                  CODE OF STATE

SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN CITY&#8217;S TAKING OVER PRIVATE &#8220;COMMUNITY&#8221;
UTILITY SYSTEMS. (ยง 8-2074)

(a) The developer shall install a utility system, both water and sewer, if
possible, using City standards as a minimum level of design.

(b) This system shall be supplied by a central temporary source from wells,
pumps and tanks and/or sewage disposal system.

(c) At such time as the area of the City expands to encompass the development
and City utility supply main and/or outfall reaches the privately developed
community-type system, an agreement may be entered into for the City to connect
to, serve and operate the system.

(d) The agreement shall provide for the line system in the streets and drainage
easements to become a part of the City system without cost.

(e) The depreciated value of the well, tank, pump and sewage disposal plant
shall be determined. The City shall then pay the developer for this
unrecoverable cost in putting in the system initially. If the line system is
found to be substandard, the cost of bringing it up to standard shall be
deducted from the amount to be paid the developer.

(f) All lots connecting to the utility system shall bear their share of the acre
connection cost, which cost may be paid lump sum or distributed over a longer
period as part of the water bill.
