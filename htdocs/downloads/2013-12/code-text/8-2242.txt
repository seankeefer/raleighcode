SUSPENSION OF REUSE SERVICE. (ยง 8-2242)

The City may suspend or terminate reuse water service at any time the reuse
water at the terminal point of the City&#8217;s treatment plant does not meet
the requirements of the governing regulatory agencies. In such a case, reuse
water service may be restored when the City determines that permit user will
comply with all the governing requirements. Within thirty (30) days following
the suspension of reuse water service, the reuse water permit holder may in
writing appeal the suspension to the Public Utilities Director, who within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the appeal shall conduct a hearing. When reuse
water is not available, the City may substitute potable water on a temporary
basis at the discretion of the City. An approved air gap separation must be used
in any connection for temporary potable water.
