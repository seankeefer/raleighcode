NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS. (ยง 8-2114)

(1) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in waste water, the POTW
Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits consistent with the
requirements set forth with 40 CFR 403.6(c).

(2) When waste water subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with waste water not regulated by the same standard, the POTW Director shall
impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR
403.6(e).

(3) A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the
user can prove, consistent with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40
CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different
from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.

(4) A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
consistent with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.15.

(5) A user may request a removal credit adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard pursuant to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.7.
