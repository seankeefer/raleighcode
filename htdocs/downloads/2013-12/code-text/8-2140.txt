BYPASS. (ยง 8-2140)

(a) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the
provisions of subsections (b) and (c) below.

(b) 

   (2) 	A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an unanticipated
   bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24)
   hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
   also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of
   the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
   and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
   and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
   to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
   reoccurence of the bypass. 
   

(c) 

   (2) 	The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
   its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will meet the
   three (3) conditions listed in subsection (c)(1) above.
