procedure for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the City of Raleigh
is hereby authorized to use, in the exercise of the power of eminent domain for
any lawful purpose, the procedure and authority prescribed in Article 9 of
Chapter 136 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as now or hereafter
amended; provided, that whenever therein the words &#8220;commission&#8221; or
&#8220;highway commission&#8221; or &#8220;state highway commission&#8221;
appear, they shall be deemed to include the &#8220;City of Raleigh,&#8221; and
whenever therein the words &#8220;director,&#8221; &#8220;Chairman,&#8221; or
&#8220;Director of Highways&#8221; or &#8220;Director of the Highway
Commission&#8221; or &#8220;Chairman of the Highway Commission&#8221; appear,

(S.L. 1955, Ch. 145, §1; S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(u)) 
Editor&#8217;s note: 1981 Session Laws, Ch. 919, repealed the grant of
condemnation authority set out above and instituted uniform eminent domain
procedures for all municipalities, codified as Chapter 40A of the General
Statutes. 1991 Session Laws, Ch. 312, §1, which amends §2.14(32), restored the
right of the City to use G.S. Ch. 136 condemnation procedures.
