                                  CODE OF STATE

OCCURRENCE OF VACANCIES. (§ I-IV-4.4)

(a) All vacancies in elective offices shall be permanent and shall occur upon
the death, removal or residence, other disqualification (such as that associated
with a violation of the law), or disability of the elective office holder. For
this purpose, a person shall be deemed to be disabled if, as a result of the
certification of a physician, or as a result of an independent investigation by
the City Council, it determines that a member is too infirm, either physically
or mentally, to discharge his duties adequately and consistently. A member shall
also be deemed to be disabled when he fails to attend six (6) consecutive
regular meetings of the City Council.

(b) A person appointed to fill a vacancy on the City Council, due to
disqualification or disability, shall be clothed with all the authority and
powers given under the laws of North Carolina to such office; but the officer so
chosen, shall be subject to recall as any other officer.
