ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS ON ASSESSMENTS. (§ 8-2036)

(a) The term &#8220;lot&#8221; as used in this section is defined as a parcel of
land owned by one (1) owner without regard to whether or not shown on any
subdivision map as separate lots and without regard to how or when acquired,
except that when as assessment is made on a per lot basis in a subdivision, the
term &#8220;lot&#8221; shall apply to each separate subdivided lot or a
combination of subdivided lots where a single building unit is constructed on a
portion of all the lots. Provided, however, that when a lot in a subdivision is
already served by a water or sewer line and the lots in the subdivision are
assessed on a per lot basis, the lot so served shall not be assessed a greater
amount than the amount which would be assessed against the lot on a linear foot
basis after giving credit for the exemptions contained in this section.

(b) The exemptions provided for in §§8-2034 and 8-2035 shall apply only if the
cost of the existing water and sewer service main has been assessed against the
property for which a duplicating service is provided, or if the existing water
or sewer main, including major mains, was installed by a subdivider of property
without cost to the City, or if the cost of the existing water or sewer service
main has been paid from community development funds and such mains are located
within redevelopment areas as delineated pursuant to Article 22 of Chapter 160A
of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended.
