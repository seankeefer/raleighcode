The owner of a probationary rental residential dwelling shall hold a permit under this part for each probationary rental residential dwelling and shall abide by the Standards in &#xA7;12-2165 in order to be eligible to retain the permit. Each probationary rental residential dwelling is a separate dwelling for fee purposes and for the requirement to be permitted. When an apartment house consisting of multiple dwelling units is required to have a probationary rental occupancy permit as a result of a violation which applies to the building as a whole, a single permit will be required for the building as a whole which permit will be issued to the owner of the building, however each dwelling unit within the building which separately qualifies as a probationary rental residential dwelling shall be subject to separate permit fees and the requirement to be permitted. The Department of Inspections shall assign violations in common areas of an apartment complex to the apartment house nearest to the common area where the violation occurred.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><section>(a)</section></prefixes><entire_prefix>(a)</entire_prefix><prefix_anchor>(a)</prefix_anchor><level>1</level></section><section id="2138" prefix="(b)"><text>Every application for the probationary rental occupancy permit prescribed herein, or a permit amendment to add another probationary rental residential dwelling to the permit, shall be upon a form approved by the Director of the Inspections Department and shall be filed with the Inspections Department.

Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application and a non-refundable application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00), the Inspections Department shall review each application and determine whether the application should be approved.
