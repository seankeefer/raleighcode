If it is determined that a project is not suitable for public art the one-half (&#xBD;) per cent of its cost will be placed into an account for the maintenance and acquisition of public art. Money held in this account may only be appropriated upon recommendation from the Public Art and Design Board. Money from this fund may be used to maintain art, acquire art for public projects that do not qualify under &#xA7;9-10007 or to supplement the one-half (&#xBD;) per cent amount for an eligible project. The fund may be used for artist design services, acquisition of art, maquettes, shipping or other expenses, including administration of the program, required to obtain and place the art. It is permissible to spend more than one-half (&#xBD;) per cent of the project cost on art for the project so long as the remainder of the cost is privately funded or paid for by an additional appropriation upon recommendation by the Public Art and Design Board.
