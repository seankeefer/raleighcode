Such ordinances may provide that the board of adjustment may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions and safeguards set forth in the ordinance, make special exceptions to the terms of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. Such ordinances may provide that the board of adjustment may authorize variances from the strict application of the regulations in such situations and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in the ordinance.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><section>(a)</section></prefixes><entire_prefix>(a)</entire_prefix><prefix_anchor>(a)</prefix_anchor><level>1</level></section><section id="5003" prefix="(b)"><text>For any and all said purposes and under a comprehensive plan, the City Council may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purpose of this section; and within such districts the City Council may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair and use of buildings, structures, and land. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of building throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts; however, the City Council may provide for the creation of conditional use zoning districts, and overlay zoning districts and transitional zoning regulations, in addition to general use districts. 
It is the purpose and intent of this section to permit the City to create, through the legislative process, general use districts, in which a variety of uses are permitted; conditional use districts, in which limited uses are permitted only upon approval by the City; and overlay zoning districts, which are applied coincidental with a general or conditional use district. Said overlay zoning districts may impose additional regulations on some property within the underlying general or conditional use district and not on all properties within those districts. 
A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land where conditional use districts or overlay districts are authorized by ordinance, may elect to request a general use district, a conditional use district, or an overlay district for the tract. 
If the petitioner elects to petition for the general use or overlay district zoning, and if the petition is approved, the rezoned property may be used for any of the uses permitted in the applicable general use or overlay district. If the petitioner elects to petition for conditional use district zoning, the petition must specify the actual use or uses, and all other development regulations authorized by State law, which are intended for the property specified in the petition. The intended use or uses and development regulations must be permitted in the corresponding general use district. If the petition is for conditional use district zoning, the City Council is to approve or disapprove the petition on the basis of the specific use or uses and development regulations requested.</text><type>section</type><prefixes><section>(b)</section></prefixes><entire_prefix>(b)</entire_prefix><prefix_anchor>(b)</prefix_anchor><level>1</level></section><section id="5004" prefix="(c)"><text>Such regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements.
