An obstruction exists as long as any impediment to the free passage of motor vehicle, vehicle, or pedestrian traffic exists. Any permittee who obstructs a street, and any person, persons, firm or corporation not having a permit who works to remove an obstruction shall, before removing the signs, signals, and channelization devices, clean the street and leave the street in a condition to handle the type of traffic that the portion so obstructed was designed to handle. All spoil and excess material shall be hauled away. Such cleaning and repair shall be done as soon as possible.
