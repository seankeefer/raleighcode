The City Council may, as part of its land development ordinances, provide that in lieu of required street right-of-way improvements, a developer may be required to provide funds that the City may use for the construction of right-of-way improvements to serve the occupants, residents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for improvements which serve more than one subdivision or development within the area. All funds received by the City pursuant to this paragraph shall be used only for development of right-of-way improvements, including design, land acquisition, and construction. However, the City may undertake these activities in conjunction with the Department of Transportation under an agreement between the City and the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The ordinance may require a combination of partial payment of funds and partial dedication of constructed improvements when the governing body of the City determines that a combination is in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served.

To construct streets outside the corporate limits but within its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Such a street may be built only after a finding by the City Council that the street is essential to the operation of an orderly transportation system for the City and the surrounding urbanized area. Upon annexation of any area in which such streets are located, the City is authorized to make special assessments against the property benefited by the improvements which were installed prior to the annexation. The City is also authorized to reimburse for overwidth streets those who build streets outside the City limits but within the extraterritorial jurisdiction for the City through the subdivision process or any other development process.

(80)	Site plans. 
The City Council may as part of its zoning regulations require that a site plan be prepared, submitted, and approved prior to the issuance of a building permit for new construction, excluding renovation and repair of existing structures, and excluding accessory uses and their structures, unless such renovations and repairs and accessory uses shall cause an increase in the off-street parking requirement or a change in occupancy as occupancy is defined by the North Carolina State Building Code. Such local law shall specify the elements to be included in site plans submitted for approval in accordance with standards of the zoning code; such elements may include, where appropriate, those relating to off-street parking, driveway access, internal circulation, screening, signs, landscaping, architectural features, locations and dimensions of buildings, topography and grading, utilities, drainage structures, street and sidewalk improvements, loading and service areas, fire hydrants, and such other elements as may reasonably be related to the health, safety and general welfare of the community. Where appropriate, approval of site plans may be conditioned to include requirements that street and utility and drainage rights-of-way, open space and recreation areas be dedicated or reserved for the public, or street, drainage, recreation, and utility improvements be made to the same extent as required by the local subdivision regulations. This provision shall not apply to additions of less than five (5) per cent of gross floor area on an annual basis unless such addition causes an increase in the off-street parking requirement or a change in occupancy as occupancy is defined by the North Carolina State Building Code. The City Council shall prescribe procedures for review and approval of such site plans to insure that development of property shall conform to applicable zoning or other relevant laws or regulations, with approvals by designated City staff, or the City Council. Appeals shall lie from the staff to the City Council. The City Council may require that site plans be in conformity with previously approved subdivision plans for the same property; further, in the event of conflict between a requirement for site plan approval and requirements for previously approved subdivision plans, the latter shall control.
