If the signals are temporarily out-of-order, then the railroad company or companies shall within a reasonable time after such malfunction or immediately where notice of said malfunction has been communicated to the railroad companies have said crossing protected by a flagman who will give ample warning to persons using the street or highway of the approach of a train until such time the train has covered the crossing; provided, however, during hours of darkness, a flare shall be maintained at the crossing during the entire passage of the train. This practice will continue until the signal system is properly restored to service.
