A backflow prevention device, as approved and required, installed within a private plumbing or distribution system to isolate a localized hazard from the remainder of said system. \nConsumer. Any person, firm, or corporation responsible for any property at which water from the City of Raleigh public water supply is received. In the absence of other parties or the failure of other parties to accept the responsibilities herein set forth, the owner of record shall be ultimately responsible. \nContainment device. A backflow prevention device, as approved and required, installed at the point of separation between the public water supply and a private service or private distribution system or at the point of metering. \nCross-connection. Any physical connection whereby the public water supply is connected with any other water supply system, whether public or private, either inside or outside of any building or buildings, in such a manner that a flow of water into the public water supply is possible either through the manipulation of valves or because of ineffective check or back-pressure valves, or because of any other arrangement. \nCross-connection control coordinator.

The assembly must be equipped with suitable connections for testing the proper operation of the device and tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the assembly. \nPublic water supply. The water and waterworks system of the City of Raleigh, and its customers outside the corporate limits, for general use and which supply is recognized as the public water supply by the North Carolina Department of Human Resources. \nReduced pressure zone principle backflow prevention device (RPZ). An approved device containing within its structure two (2) spring loaded independently operating check valves, together with an automatically operating pressure differential relief valve located between the two (2) check valves. The first check valve reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow the pressure between the checks shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the check valves less than the supply pressure. This device shall have suitable connections for testing the proper operation of the device, including tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the device. \n(Ord.
