Most water leaks are easy to detect and repair with basic plumbing skills and a few simple tools. \n3.\tHave soil tested by the North Carolina Department of Agronomy\/Soil Testing Section. Most yards in this region are composed of granite soils. They need lime more than they need fertilizer. \n4.\tPlant native trees and shrubs. The North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension Service has excellent suggestions for home gardeners. Use mulch around shrubs and garden plants to reduce evaporation. Mix the turf areas with shaded areas to reduce irrigation demands. \n5.\tLet the grass grow taller in hot weather by raising your lawn mower cutting height. Longer grass blades help shade each other, reduce evaporation, and inhibit weed growth. \n6.\tWater slowly and thoroughly during cool, windless hours to prevent water loss from evaporation.\n7.\tBe attentive if using a hose and sprinkler, consider setting an alarm or the oven timer as a reminder to move the hose and sprinkler as needed. \n8.\tUse a rain gauge. One (1) inch of water per week will keep lawns green throughout the summer.\n9.\tWater should be applied slowly to achieve deep penetration and prevent water run-off.\n10.\tDo not water impervious surfaces such as streets, parking lots, driveways and sidewalks.\n11.\tInstall a drip irrigation system for watering gardens, trees, and shrubs. Drip systems are very efficient because they provide a slow, steady trickle of water to plants at their roots through a network of hidden pipes and hoses. \n12.\tUse properly treated reuse water for irrigation as an alternative water source. Raleigh&#8217;s water conservation rules do not regulate the amount of reuse water and therefore any amount can be used during any mandatory water conservation stage. Contact the Raleigh Public Utilities Department for information regarding reuse water availability. \n13.\tCapture rain water in cisterns and rain barrels. The average rainfall in the Raleigh area is about forty-eight (48) inches per year. Run-off from the roof of a typical two thousand five hundred (2,500) square foot home is about seventy-five thousand (75,000) gallons a year.

Do not leave water running &#8211; use spring loaded or other automatic shut-off devices on hoses or outdoor faucets. \n15.\tUse commercial vehicle washing facilities, especially those which have been certified by Raleigh as water conserving facilities, instead of washing vehicles at home. \n16.\tUse a broom or blower to remove dust, dirt, leaves and other debris from sidewalks, driveways, porches and decks rather than water.\r\r(b) Indoor Water Uses: \n1.\tThaw frozen food in your refrigerator or microwave instead of using running water.
