Within ninety (90) days\n   after this section becomes effective, every person or other entity which\n   places or maintains a newsrack on the streets of the City of Raleigh shall\n   have the vendor&#8217;s name, address and telephone number affixed thereto in\n   a place where such information may be easily seen. A uniform sticker shall be\n   supplied by the Inspections Department for this purpose. Any newsrack\n   installed, used or maintained in violation of the provisions of this section\n   shall be tagged with a &#8220;notice of violation&#8221; stating the\n   violation, date of tagging, notice of intention to remove the newsrack if the\n   violation is not corrected within ten (10) days or procedure for obtaining a\n   hearing before the Inspections Department is made giving the owner of the\n   newsrack opportunity to be heard regarding the violation. The Inspections\n   Department or its designate may, as an alternative to tagging said newsrack,\n   move, align, or otherwise reposition such rack or racks in order to restore\n   them to a legal condition. Any newsrack which has been tagged and remains in\n   violation of the provisions stated on the tag past the ten-day correction\n   period, and for which no hearing has been requested, shall be removed by the\n   Inspections Department or its designate and stored in a secure location. The\n   Inspections Department or its designate shall notify the owner thereof by\n   mailing a &#8220;notice of removal&#8221; to the last known address of the\n   owner. Such notice shall state the date the newsrack was removed, the reasons\n   therefor, the procedure for obtaining a post-removal hearing before the\n   Inspections Department, if desired. Any such newsrack removed and stored\n   pursuant to these provisions shall be released to the owner thereof if claimed\n   within forty-five (45) days after such removal and upon the payment of\n   reasonable charges of removal and storage. Upon failure of the owner to claim\n   such newsrack and pay the reasonable charges within forty-five (45) days after\n   the mailing of written notice of removal, such newsrack shall be deemed to be\n   unclaimed property in possession of the Police Department and may be disposed\n   of pursuant to the provisions outlined in the Code of the City of Raleigh. Any\n   newsrack in violation of the provisions of this section, which violation\n   creates an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of the public,\n   which violation cannot be corrected by moving or otherwise repositioning the\n   newsrack, may be summarily removed and stored in a secure location so as to\n   eliminate the danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public. The\n   Inspections Department or its designate shall notify the owner as outlined in\n   this section. Every person or other entity which places or maintains a\n   newsrack on a public sidewalk or right-of-way in the City of Raleigh shall\n   file a written statement with the Inspections Department satisfactory to the\n   City Attorney whereby he or it agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City,\n   its officers, councilmen and employees, from any loss or liability or damage,\n   including expenses and costs, for bodily or personal injury, and for property\n   damage sustained by any person as a result of the installation, use, or\n   maintenance of a newsrack within the City of Raleigh. \n   (Code 1959 , \u00a719-5.1; Ord.
