Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days before the discharge commences.

Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.

Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth\nin 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge\n(continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred\n(100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification\nalso shall contain the following information to the extent such information is\nknown and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous\nconstituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and\nconcentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the\ncalendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such\nconstituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following\ntwelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred\nand eighty (180) days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin\nthe discharge until receipt of written approval from the City. Any notification\nunder this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste\ndischarge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under\n\u00a78-2132 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not\napply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical\npretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of \u00a7\u00a78-2128,\n8-2130, and 8-2131 of this article.\n\n(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during\na calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of\nhazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40\nCFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of\nnon-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute\nhazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a\none-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more\nthan such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional\nnotification.\n\n(c) In the case of any new regulation under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying\nadditional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional\nsubstance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA\nRegional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste\nauthorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the\neffective date of such regulations.\n\n(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall\ncertify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of\nhazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically\npractical.\n\n(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not\notherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued there\nunder, or any applicable Federal or state law. \n(Ord.
