The owner of a probationary rental residential dwelling shall hold a permit under this part for each probationary rental residential dwelling and shall abide by the Standards in \u00a712-2165 in order to be eligible to retain the permit. Each probationary rental residential dwelling is a separate dwelling for fee purposes and for the requirement to be permitted. When an apartment house consisting of multiple dwelling units is required to have a probationary rental occupancy permit as a result of a violation which applies to the building as a whole, a single permit will be required for the building as a whole which permit will be issued to the owner of the building, however each dwelling unit within the building which separately qualifies as a probationary rental residential dwelling shall be subject to separate permit fees and the requirement to be permitted. The Department of Inspections shall assign violations in common areas of an apartment complex to the apartment house nearest to the common area where the violation occurred.\r\r(b) Every application for the probationary rental occupancy permit prescribed herein, or a permit amendment to add another probationary rental residential dwelling to the permit, shall be upon a form approved by the Director of the Inspections Department and shall be filed with the Inspections Department. Every application shall be made under oath and shall contain the information required to show the owner is eligible for a permit under this article and sufficient information to enable the Inspections Department to determine that the standards of \u00a712-2165 are being, or will be, met at any probationary rental residential dwelling to be permitted. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application and a non-refundable application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00), the Inspections Department shall review each application and determine whether the application should be approved. The Inspections Department shall deny any application which does not satisfy the minimum requirements of this article and any application submitted by an owner during a period of permit revocation.\r\r(c) The permit fee shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the first year of the permit. The annual fee for subsequent years shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fee shall be due and payable when the permit issues with annual fees for subsequent years due and payable annually.\r\r(d) Any person required to have a probationary rental occupancy permit shall be permitted for two (2) years. If a violation of the permit occurs, the permit requirement is extended for the probationary rental residential dwelling covered by the permit for two (2) years following the date of the violation.

Final inspections will be conducted only upon the request of the owner. When the owner fails to request an inspection within ninety (90) days after the date the permit requirement was due to expire, the Department of Inspections, after written notice to the owner and tenant, shall inspect the permitted dwelling for compliance with the Code provisions listed in \u00a712-2163(l) and the standards in \u00a712-2165\r\r(f) A temporary permit shall be issued by the Inspections Department if the final decision on a complete application is not made at the end of the thirty (30) day review period.

The refusal of service by the process service agent of a notice of violation or order, or a notice of violation or orders returned undelivered, shall be grounds to revoke the permit.
