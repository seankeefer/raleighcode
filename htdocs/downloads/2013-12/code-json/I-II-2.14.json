The City Council after recommendation by the Planning\n   Commission shall determine the location and size of any such reservations and\n   shall cause those locations to appear on the City&#8217;s Comprehensive Land\n   Use Plan. If the City enacts ordinances pursuant to this authority those\n   ordinances shall provide, in part, that any subdivision submitted for approval\n   which includes any such reservation or any request for a building permit not\n   involving subdivision approval which includes such a reservation, the\n   administrative official charged with receiving such request shall give notice\n   of the request to the City Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting.\n   The Council shall decide at that meeting whether it still wishes to require\n   the reservation.

Such a street may be built only after a finding\n   by the City Council that the street is essential to the operation of an\n   orderly transportation system for the City and the surrounding urbanized area.\n   Upon annexation of any area in which such streets are located, the City is\n   authorized to make special assessments against the property benefited by the\n   improvements which were installed prior to the annexation. The City is also\n   authorized to reimburse for overwidth streets those who build streets outside\n   the City limits but within the extraterritorial jurisdiction for the City\n   through the subdivision process or any other development process. In order to\n   effect this reimbursement the City is authorized to establish reimbursement\n   zones and to determine reimbursement rates for each zone. \n   Amendment note: 1983 Session Laws, Ch. 272, \u00a71, amended \u00a722 of Ch. 1184\n   Session Laws 1949 by adding subparagraph (79). \n   (80)\tSite plans. \n   The City Council may as part of its zoning regulations require that a site\n   plan be prepared, submitted, and approved prior to the issuance of a building\n   permit for new construction, excluding renovation and repair of existing\n   structures, and excluding accessory uses and their structures, unless such\n   renovations and repairs and accessory uses shall cause an increase in the\n   off-street parking requirement or a change in occupancy as occupancy is\n   defined by the North Carolina State Building Code. Such local law shall\n   specify the elements to be included in site plans submitted for approval in\n   accordance with standards of the zoning code; such elements may include, where\n   appropriate, those relating to off-street parking, driveway access, internal\n   circulation, screening, signs, landscaping, architectural features, locations\n   and dimensions of buildings, topography and grading, utilities, drainage\n   structures, street and sidewalk improvements, loading and service areas, fire\n   hydrants, and such other elements as may reasonably be related to the health,\n   safety and general welfare of the community. Where appropriate, approval of\n   site plans may be conditioned to include requirements that street and utility\n   and drainage rights-of-way, open space and recreation areas be dedicated or\n   reserved for the public, or street, drainage, recreation, and utility\n   improvements be made to the same extent as required by the local subdivision\n   regulations. This provision shall not apply to additions of less than five (5)\n   per cent of gross floor area on an annual basis unless such addition causes an\n   increase in the off-street parking requirement or a change in occupancy as\n   occupancy is defined by the North Carolina State Building Code. The City\n   Council shall prescribe procedures for review and approval of such site plans\n   to insure that development of property shall conform to applicable zoning or\n   other relevant laws or regulations, with approvals by designated City staff,\n   or the City Council. Appeals shall lie from the staff to the City Council. The\n   City Council may require that site plans be in conformity with previously\n   approved subdivision plans for the same property; further, in the event of\n   conflict between a requirement for site plan approval and requirements for\n   previously approved subdivision plans, the latter shall control. \n   Amendment note: 1985 Session Laws, Ch. 498, \u00a71, amended \u00a722 of Ch. 1184\n   Session Laws 1949 by adding subparagraph (80). 1987 Session Laws, Ch. 514,\n   \u00a72, amended subparagraph (80) by adding reference to drainage and open space\n   and recreation areas in the third sentence. \n   \n\n   (81. \tRoad or drainage projects fee.\n"}
