The licensed irrigation contractor will follow the guidelines\nset forth by the Irrigation Association&#8217;s (IA) Irrigation Audit Guidelines\n(found in the Public Utilities Handbook and at: http:\/\/www.irrigation.org) to\nconduct an irrigation audit. The overall system must maintain a distribution\nuniformity (DU) of no less than fifty (50) per cent, and the results of said\naudit must be submitted to the City for approval in the format provided by the\nIrrigation Association. The auditor should inspect the installation of the\nbackflow prevention assembly, main line, laterals, valves, sprinkler heads,\ndrip\/micro-irrigation equipment, control wire, controller, rain sensor, timer or\ncontroller and any other water conserving devices, and should assure that the\nintent of the irrigation designer or consultant has been preserved. In addition,\nthe audit shall also verify the installation of specified water management\ndevices such as a rain shutoff device and\/or soil moisture sensors. Finally, the\nirrigation schedule shall be evaluated to assure that the irrigation system\nmeets the supplemental water needs of the plants without wasting water. Systems\nwhich fail to meet the standards of the audit will have a period of two (2)\nweeks to correct the problem or result in having their irrigation service\ninterrupted. \nIrrigation system. Set of components which may include a hose, piping, fittings,\nsprinklers, drip tubing, valves, and control wiring connected to a water source\nor water distribution network which is used to apply water to residential or\ncommercial lawns, landscapes or other areas. \nLicensed irrigation contractor. A licensed irrigation contractor is an\nirrigation professional, who has met a set of minimum standards specified by the\nNorth Carolina Irrigation Contractors&#8217; Licensing Board under Chapter 89G\nof the North Carolina General Statutes. \nMajor water user. A water customer who uses one hundred thousand (100,000)\ngallons per day (GPD) or more per account as determined on either an annual or\nan average day during the City seasonal water demand period. \nNon-automatic spray irrigation system. Any installed irrigation system that is\nconnected to the City&#8217;s public water supply system and which is operated\nmanually. \nOn-site reuse water. On-site reuse water is effluent water from an individual\non-site wastewater system which meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of the\ncurrent North Carolina Reuse and Reclaimed Water Quality Standards. \nPotable water. Potable water is the water from the public water supply system of\nthe City which meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of the current Federal\nand North Carolina Safe Drinking Water Act. \nProgrammable timer. An automatic timing device, connected either wired or\nwireless to remotely control valves and irrigation heads according to a set\nirrigation schedule. An approved timer must: (a) have the ability to program\nmandatory watering restrictions to include days and times; (b) register\nrun-times as low as one-minute increments; and (c) be connected to an approved\nwater conservation add-on device which will block the operation of the system if\nirrigation is unnecessary. \nProjection period. The remaining number of days in the calendar year from the\ndate of the water supply projection, plus sixty (60) days. \nPublic water supply. The water supply of the City, and its customers for general\nuse and which supply is recognized as the public water supply of the City by the\nNorth Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. \nRain sensor (RS) or rain shut-off device or rain switch. A device designed to\ninterrupt an automatic irrigation system&#8217;s cycle during periods of rain.\nApproved rain sensors, rain shut-off, or rain switch will be designed to shut\noff after one-fourth (\u00bc) of an inch of rain has fallen, and be at least five\n(5) feet from a house or building. \nReuse water. City reuse water and\/or on-site reuse water. \nRoot zone (RZ). The depth of the soil from which the crop roots extract water\nand nutrients. \nRun-times (RT). The operating time of an irrigation zone for a single irrigation\ncycle. \nSeasonal demand period. The period of time from April 1st through November 30th.\n\nSmart controller. Smart controllers estimate or measure the available soil\nmoisture, rainfall, wind, slope, soil, plant type, temperature (and more) of\nlocal conditions to operate an irrigation system, replenishing water as needed\nwhile maximizing water efficiency. A properly programmed smart controller\nrequires initial site specific set-up and will make irrigation schedule\nadjustments, including run times and required cycles, throughout the irrigation\nseason without human intervention. Approved systems will include a programmable\nirrigation controller and a weather based controller. \nSoil moisture sensor (SMS). A device which is either wired or connecting to the\nprogram controller to override an irrigation system&#8217;s cycle when there is\na determined level of moisture within the soil. \nThe Irrigation Association\u00ae (IA). A specific non-profit organization\nestablished to improve the products and practices used to manage water resources\nand to help shape the worldwide business environment of the irrigation industry.\nThe IA has developed irrigation certification, audit guidelines and audit result\nworksheets to facilitate sustainable water management. \nWater conservation device. An approved water conservation device, properly\ninstalled to improve water use efficiency within the irrigation system. These\ndevices include: rain shutoff device, soil moisture sensors, weather stations,\nhigh-wind shutoff device, freeze protection devices, flow meter with totalizer,\nautomated control system, matched precipitation rate nozzles, flow control\nnozzles, pressure regulators, multi-stream rotating nozzles, high flow\nshut-offs, and drip and micro- irrigation technologies. \nWater demand average. The average daily amount of water pumped from the City\nwater plant(s) for the previous thirty (30) day period. \nWater shortage. A &#8220;water shortage&#8221; shall exist when the demands and\nrequirements of water customers served by the City cannot be satisfied without\ndepleting the water supply to or below a critical level, the level at which the\ncontinued availability of water for human consumption, sanitation and fire\nprotection is jeopardized. \nWater Shortage Response Plan. A document which establishes authority for\ndeclaration of a water shortage, defines different stages of water shortage\nseverity, and outlines appropriate responses for each stage. \nWeather-based sensor. A sensor that measures local weather conditions such as\nrain, temperature, soil conditions and\/or evapotranspiration. The City Code\nrequires each system to incorporate two (2) sensors, each monitoring a separate\nweather characteristic, to be used as an add-on device to suspend irrigation\ncycles when watering is deemed unnecessary by the conditions of the sensor. \n(Ord.
