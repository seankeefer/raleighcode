These general prohibitions apply to all users or\nconsumers of a POTW whether or not the user or consumer is a significant\nindustrial user or subject to any national, state, or local pretreatment\nstandards or requirements.\n\n(b) \n\n   (1) \tPollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,\n   including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of\n   less than one hundred forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty (60) degrees\n   Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. \n   \n\n   (2) \tSolid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of\n   the flow in the POTW resulting in interference [but in no case solids greater\n   than one-quarter (\u00bc) inch in any dimension]. \n   \n\n   (3) \tPetroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil\n   origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; but in no\n   case, concentrations greater than one hundred (100) mg\/l. \n   \n\n   (4) \tAny waste water having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.0 or waste\n   water having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage to the\n   POTW or equipment. Any pH above 12.5 is considered hazardous under 40 CFR\n   261.22. \n   \n\n   (5) \tAny waste water containing pollutants, including oxygen-demanding\n   pollutants, in sufficient quantity (flow and\/or concentration), either singly\n   or by interaction with other pollutants, to cause interference with the POTW.\n   \n   \n\n   (6) \tAny waste water having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty (150)\n   degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-six (66) degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit\n   biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but\n   in no case waste water which causes the temperature at the introduction into\n   the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit (forty\n   (40) degrees Celsius). \n   \n\n   (7) \tAny pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or\n   fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and\n   safety problems. \n   \n\n   (8) \tAny trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated\n   by the POTW Director in accordance with \u00a78-2121 of this article. \n   \n\n   (9) \tAny noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids or other waste water\n   which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to\n   create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry\n   into the sewers for maintenance and repair. \n   (10)\tAny substance which may cause the POTW&#8217;s effluent or any other\n   product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for\n   reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case\n   shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance\n   with sludge use or disposal regulations or permits issued under Section 405 of\n   the Act; the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances\n   Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method\n   being used. \n   \n\n   (11. \tAny waste water which imparts color which cannot be removed by the\n   pretreatment process, including, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable\n   tanning solutions, which consequently imparts sufficient color to the\n   treatment plant&#8217;s effluent to render the waters injurious to public\n   health or secondary recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or to adversely\n   affect the palatability of fish or aesthetic quality or impair the receiving\n   waters for any designated uses. \n   \n\n   (12. \tAny waste water containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except as\n   specifically approved by the POTW Director in compliance with applicable state\n   or Federal regulations. \n   \n\n   (13. \tStormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof\n   runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized\n   water, noncontact cooling water and unpolluted industrial waste water, unless\n   specifically authorized by the POTW Director. \n   \n\n   (14. \tFats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations\n   greater than one hundred (100) mg\/l, unless specifically authorized by the\n   POTW Director. \n   \n\n   (15. \tAny sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of\n   industrial wastes, unless specifically authorized by the POTW Director. \n   \n\n   (16. \tAny medical wastes, except as specifically authorized in the medical\n   facility&#8217;s Policy for Disposal of Medical Wastes after it has been\n   approved by the POTW Director as an attachment to and as part of the medical\n   facility&#8217;s waste water discharge permit. \n   \n\n   (17. \tAny material containing ammonia, ammonia salts, or other chelating\n   agents which will produce metallic complexes that interfere with the municipal\n   waste water system. \n   \n\n   (18. \tAny material that would be identified as hazardous waste according to 40\n   CFR Part 261 if not disposed of in a sewer except as may be specifically\n   authorized by the POTW Director. \n   \n\n   (19. \tAny waste water causing the treatment plant effluent to violate state\n   water quality standards for toxic substances as described in 15A NCAC 2B\n   .0200. \n   (20)\tWaste water causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the\n   treatment plant&#8217;s effluent to fail a toxicity test. \n   \n\n   (21. \tRecognizable portions of the human or animal anatomy.\n   \n\n   (22. \tAny wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other\n   substances which may cause excessive foaming in the municipal waste water\n   system. \n   \n\n   (23. \tAt no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard\n   meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the\n   system) be more than five (5) per cent nor any single reading over ten (10)\n   per cent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. \n   \n\n   (24. \tAny type of paper product, other than toilet paper.\n   \n\n   (25. \tAny type of cloth, including diapers and wash cloths.\n   \n\n   (26. \tAny type of disposable diaper.\n   \n\n   (27. \tAny type of tobacco product, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing\n   tobacco, and snuff.\n   \n\n   (28. \tAny type of condom.\n   \n\n   (29. \tAny type of personal hygiene product, including tampons, sanitary\n   napkins, and towelettes.\n   (30)\tWood, debris, or wood product, including trees, limbs, roots, leaves,\n   yard waste, grass clippings, or lumber.\n   \n\n   (31. \tConstruction material, debris, or tools, including rocks, gravel,\n   cement, concrete, masonry bricks or block, shovels, and hand tools. \n   \n\n   (32. \tAdhesives, glue, dye, or stones used in the manufacture of products.\n   \n\n   (33. \tProduct containers, including boxes, bottles, cans, or buckets.\n   \n\n   (34. \tAppliances or parts of appliances.\n   \n\n   (35. \tVehicles or parts of vehicles.\n   \n\n   (36. \tRope, string, twine, thread, or similar materials.\n   \n\n   (37. \tMaterial made of fabric, including carpet, blankets, sheets, sleeping\n   bags.\n   \n\n   (38. \tTrash bags, whether paper or plastic.\n   \n\n   (39. \tAll other solids or liquids, other than wastes from the human body, that\n   may accumulate in sewer pipes and cause or contribute to blockages. \n   \n\n(c) Processing and storage of prohibited pollutants, substances, etc. \nPollutants, substances, waste water, or other wastes prohibited by this section\nshall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged\nto the municipal waste water system. All floor drains located in process or\nmaterials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user&#8217;s\npretreatment facility before connecting with the system.\n\n(d) \n\n   (1) \tAdvise the user(s) or consumer(s) of the potential impact of the\n   contribution on the POTW in accordance with \u00a78-2140.4 of this article; and \n   \n\n   (2) \tTake appropriate actions in accordance with Division 4 of this article\n   for such user or consumer to protect the POTW from interference or pass\n   through. \n   (Ord.
